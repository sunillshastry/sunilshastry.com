# Hitting the road running

My first blog post! Makes me remember the first time I encountered something like `console.log()` or
`printf()`, when learning a new language. Simple, basic (pretty useless though), but the beginning of something new and something interesting.

I've been wanting to start a blog for a while. Not because I have everything figured out _(spoiler: I'm still uncertain and haven't figured out a thing)_, but because I think it will be fun to share and build in public about what I work on. Plus, I know I forget stuff all the time - so if nothing else, this will be my personal scratch note on the internet!

## But what?

Most of what I might write about will probably revolve around full-stack development, mathematics, and probably some system design concepts, and all the messy bits in between - basically, a bunch of nerdy stuff.

Although I delve and dabble with topics other than full-stack (web) development, I'm mostly fixated on it, mainly due to not only my personal expertise but also my interests. Perhaps as I work through more projects with other languages and frameworks, I shall make an effort to make my blogs diverse without clinging to the same sticks and stones on a regular basis.

Furthermore, I don't really have a strict plan for how these posts will look and end up in the long run. Sometimes it might be a quick how-to or code snippet, or even a full-blown tutorial-like blog. Other times it could be me rambling about a project I'm working on, or something I broke and then (hopefully) fixed.

I'm not necessarily aiming for perfection _(although I wouldn't mind that)_, or any shiny and polished tutorials you'd see in some course. Think of it more like a helpful gist, or just my trashbin on the internet _(probably no in-betweens)_.

## Potential Commitments?

Honestly, for this question, I would just quote 2008's popular romantic comedy starring Ryan Reynolds - **_"Definitely, Maybe"_**. It's just hard to make it a habit at this point, at least, but as I consider it, I think writing feels like a good way to slow down and really think through what I'm doing, and even how I'm doing it. It's a nice thing to build something, but it's probably better to explain and build it in plain words - this is really what I'm going for with this whole idea about blogging.

That might just be a wrap! I didn't really have any big takeaways or hot tech tips on this one. It's really just a start. My boring, old ‚Äúhello world‚Äù. From here, I will be writing about whatever I'm working on. Some posts will be short, some long, some probably chaotic, and some ridiculously boring. But that's kinda the point. Later!
