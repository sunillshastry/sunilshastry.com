				<p>
					I am an undergraduate student at the University of Saskatchewan ,
					Canada, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree with a major
					in Computer Science and a minor in Theoretical Mathematics. My
					academic interests within computer science primarily focus on Web
					Development and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) , where I explore the
					design, functionality, and user experience aspects of digital systems.
					In the field of mathematics, I am particularly drawn to Linear Algebra
					and Discrete Mathematics , as they complement and provide foundational
					insights into abstract structures, logical reasoning, and
					computational applications. View resume â†’

					Outside of programming and university, I enjoy the activities of
					cooking, hiking, and watching movies (mostly thriller). Feel free to
					connect with me on LinkedIn or view my open-source work and projects
					on GitHub.
