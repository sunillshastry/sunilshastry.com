			<h2>My name is Sunil Shastry</h2>
			<p>
				I am an undergraduate student at the
				<a href="https://www.usask.ca/">University of Saskatchewan</a>, Canada,
				currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Computer
				Science and a minor in Theoretical Mathematics. My academic interests
				within computer science primarily focus on
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development">
					Web Development
				</a>
				and
				<a
					href="https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/what-is-hci/"
				>
					Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) </a
				>, where I explore the design, functionality, and user experience
				aspects of digital systems. In the field of mathematics, I am
				particularly drawn to
				<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/linear-algebra">
					Linear Algebra
				</a>
				and
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics">
					Discrete Mathematics</a
				>, as they complement and provide foundational insights into abstract
				structures, logical reasoning, and computational applications.
			</p>

			<p>
				I possess strong proficiency in multiple programming languages and
				frameworks, including <strong>JavaScript</strong>
				<i>(React, Node.js, Vue)</i>, <strong>Python</strong>,
				<strong>Java</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and
				<strong>C++</strong>. In addition to my coding expertise, I have a solid
				understanding of various no-code and low-code technologies, particularly
				in areas such as version control systems, including
				<strong>Git</strong>, as well as essential development tools like
				<strong>Linux</strong> and <strong>Docker</strong>. Furthermore, my
				experience extends to software engineering principles, encompassing
				ethical considerations, best practices, and established design patterns,
				which I have applied in both academic and practical settings.
