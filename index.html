		<h1>Namaste.</h1>
		<h2>My name is Sunil Shastry</h2>
		<p>
			I am an undergraduate student at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada,
			currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Computer
			Science and a minor in Theoretical Mathematics. My academic interests
			within computer science primarily focus on Web Development and
			Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), where I explore the design,
			functionality, and user experience aspects of digital systems. In the
			field of mathematics, I am particularly drawn to Linear Algebra and Set
			Theory, as they complement and provide foundational insights into abstract
			structures, logical reasoning, and computational applications.
