		<h1><a href="#">Namaste.</a></h1>
		<h2>My name is Sunil Shastry</h2>
		<p>
			I am an undergraduate student at the
			<a href="https://www.usask.ca/">University of Saskatchewan</a>, Canada,
			currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Computer
			Science and a minor in Theoretical Mathematics. My academic interests
			within computer science primarily focus on
			<a href="#">Web Development</a> and
			<a href="#">Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</a>, where I explore the
			design, functionality, and user experience aspects of digital systems. In
			the field of mathematics, I am particularly drawn to
			<a href="#">Linear Algebra</a> and <a href="#">Discrete Mathematics</a>,
			as they complement and provide foundational insights into abstract
			structures, logical reasoning, and computational applications.
		</p>

		<p>
			I possess strong proficiency in multiple programming languages and
			frameworks, including JavaScript, Python, Java, TypeScript, React, Vue,
			and C++. In addition to my coding expertise, I have a solid understanding
			of various no-code and low-code technologies, particularly in areas such
			as version control systems, including Git, as well as essential
			development tools like Linux and Docker. Furthermore, my experience
			extends to software engineering principles, encompassing ethical
			considerations, best practices, and established design patterns, which I
			have applied in both academic and practical settings.
